# Geo Data Analysis

This repository contains a series of tasks related to geographical data analysis. These tasks involve calculating spherical distances, understanding the concept of polygons in geoinformatics, and visualizing geographical data using tools like MySQL Workbench, Python, and QGIS.

## Task 1: Spherical Distance and Speed Calculation (MySQL Workbench)

- Calculate the spherical distance between the departure and return stations.
- Determine the speed at which the journey was completed.
- Utilize MySQL Workbench for this task.

## Task 2: Understanding Polygons in Geoinformatics

- Explain the concept of a polygon in geoinformatics in your own words.
- Describe the significance of polygons in geoinformatics.
- Detail how to create a polygon in MySQL, referencing the MySQL 8 documentation.

## Task 3: Spherical Distance and Speed Calculation (Python)

- Calculate the spherical distance between the departure and return stations.
- Determine the speed at which the journey was completed.
- Use Python for this task, making use of the provided template.
- Calculate the geodetic distance as well.
- Compare the results of both calculations.
- Discuss whether the results match and provide reasons if they don't.

**Note:** Spherical distance is also known as "great-circle distance." For more details on geopy and great-circle distance, refer to the [geopy documentation](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Task 4: Data Visualization in QGIS

- Visualize the departure and return stations for "trip_id 487868" in QGIS.
- Use suitable tools in QGIS to measure the distance between these two points.
